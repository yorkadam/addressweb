# addressweb - HTML & Python Based Address Book

##Description
A simple stand-alone address book for keeping track of people’s addresses, contact information, identification, and relationships. 
This address book software is written in Python, javascript, html, sqlite, and uses cherrypy.

##Why create another address book?

I created this address book because I was frustrated with current address book solutions which try to integrate everything. 
The current software-industry ( or projects ) trend towards pushing users personal information into the cloud is alarming, 
not so-much about where the data is stored but how badly data is leaked, hacked, and compelled ( by law enforcement ) 
for data access. Additionally, cloud services have let me down by corrupting my data, failing to secure my data, 
and the worse offense of all; deleting my data when I needed it most.

Perhaps, more simply-put, I wanted an address book that no-one may control but me, is simple, and cloudless. 
After all clouds mean rain and I’ve had enough of it.
